# Monthly costs

ux4iot is installed in your Azure subscription using the Azure Marketplace. The costs can be divided into two parts:

* Azure Resource costs from the Azure resources that ux4iot is made up of
* Monthly fee for a ux4iot instance

The Azure Resource costs may vary depending on the terms that your company has negotiated with Microsoft. Also, they are somewhat dependent on usage. You can expect, however, that these costs will be around €70 / $81 per month.

The monthly fee for a ux4iot instance \(independent of usage\) is €69 / $80.

**Therefore, the total cost for using a ux4iot instance per month is around: €139 / $162.**

Billing is done through your existing Azure subscription.
